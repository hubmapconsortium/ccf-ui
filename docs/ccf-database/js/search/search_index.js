This will be added in December with its scheduled refresh.\n\nRUI 1.0 BETA - 2020-10-16\nAdded in RUI 1.0 BETA\n\nCreated the first version of the RUI 1.0.

Initial embedding documentation is available here.\nWhen adjusting transparency via the left-hand Anatomical Structures menu or Show Previous Registrations option, the transparency effect is not very good. This will be addressed before the RUI 1.0 production release.\nSometimes the 3d organ fails to load when clicking through reference organs quickly (and other side cases). If this happens, just refresh and try again.\n\n1.1.0 - 2020-07-31\nAdded in 1.1.0\n\nUpgraded to latest Vitessce Image Viewer and started showing processed TIFF images coming directly from the HuBMAP infrastructure\nProcessed CODEX and 10x datasets are shown in the HuBMAP Portal's visualization tool\nAdded a limited set of TIFF image thumbnails, with more to come\nAdded two qualitative color schemes for colorizing images in the image viewer\nBug fixes/performance optimizations\n\n1.0.0-rc.1 - 2020-06-22\n\n:warning: WARNING: This version is a release candidate.
