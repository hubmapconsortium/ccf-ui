Initial embedding documentation is available here.\nWhen adjusting transparency via the left-hand Anatomical Structures menu or Show Previous Registrations option, the transparency effect is not very good. This will be addressed before the RUI 1.0 production release.\nSometimes the 3d organ fails to load when clicking through reference organs quickly (and other side cases).
