95% reduction in load times!\nMinor graphical fixes\n\n3.1.1 - 2022-04-12\nAdded in 3.1.1\n\nExpanded RUI web component options\nAdded support for warming up the CCF database via the CCF-API so that the EUI can prevent timeouts\n\n3.1.0 - 2022-04-07\nAdded in 3.1.0\n\nAdded support for the latest CCF Ontology v1.8.0 which adds cell types\nAdded feature to search for tissue blocks by cell
