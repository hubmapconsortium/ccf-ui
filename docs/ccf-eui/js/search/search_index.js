This improves the performance in both organ-info and EUI.\nImproved styling of organ-info\n\n2.2.0 - 2021-09-10\nAdded in 2.2.0\n\nAdded an organ-info web component for displaying reference organs and associated data in a simple panel display. The hubmap portal will be using this soon for organ pages.\nEMBEDDING.md instructions have been updated for organ-info embedding.\n\n2.1.0 - 2021-07-30\nAdded in EUI / RUI 2.1.0\n\nBetter support for embedding EUI/RUI in different containers, see EMBEDDING.md for updated instructions.\nConfiguration updates:\nConfiguration of EUI/RUI via webcomponent properties (vs globalConfig)\nOptional use of ontology id to select reference organs in the RUI\nRemoved embedded and tutorial mode configurations from the RUI config\nAbility to load data sources in the eui via external configuration\nAdded cancelRegistration callback to rui external configuration\n\n\nSet dark/light theme based on user/OS preferences\nUpdate HuBMAP search processing to conform to new field names\nCode cleanup, shared utilities, etc.\nTelemetry dialog box fixes to avoid unnecessary reloads\nRUI gizmo rotates in sync with the reference organ in 3D preview view\nRUI now uses an orthographic view when in registration views\n\n2.0.0 - 2021-07-16\nAdded in EUI / RUI 2.0.0\n\nRUI and EUI are now basic web-components, see EMBEDDING.md\nAdded advanced google analytics tracking/telemetry\nLinked donor card and tissue block hovering\nUpdated dependencies, including upgrading to Angular 12\nMinor UI and Bug fixes\nUpdated demo video links\nOrgan carousel will respond to container width and show only full icons\nEUI: clicking refresh and selecting body on partonomy resets the body view\n\nBreaking changes in EUI / RUI 2.0.0\n\nEmbedding the EUI and RUI must now be done via web-components. The most significant change is the element is no longer called ccf-root but is instead called ccf-eui or ccf-rui depending on the UI being embedded.\n\n1.7.0 - 2021-05-21\nAdded in EUI / RUI 1.7.0\n\nAdded a startup modal to the RUI which simplifies the initial setup for a new registration\nAdded 8 new reference organs, bringing us to 13 Reference Organs!\nAdded SPARC Registrations to the EUI\nAdded a tissue section visualization to the results list in the EUI\n\n1.6.0 - 2021-04-09\nAdded in RUI 1.6.0\n\nAdded SOP information to the About section\n\nAdded in EUI 1.6.0\n\nAdded color assignment/selection to both 3d scene and list results\nBug fixes, code cleanup, and optimization\n\nKnown issues in 1.6.0\n\nThe 3d scene is a little slow. To be able to interact, unselect reference organs to reduce scene complexity.\nTissue samples may be a little off in the 3D scene. This will be fixed in a future release. Data is still accurate.\n\n1.5.0 - 2021-03-26\nAdded in RUI 1.5.0\n\nMinor styling updates\n\nAdded in EUI 1.5.0\nNOTE: EUI will not be pushed to production during this cycle as there are some features not fully integrated. This should be resolved in the next release scheduled for April 9th. You can view the results of this sprint on staging.\n\nUpdated styling to better fit the user interface spec\nAdded a new results pane which structures data into Donor->Tissue Blocks (+Datasets)->Tissue Samples (+Datasets)\nAdded a link viewer that allows us to display donors, samples, and datasets in a frame within the application\nAdded UFL thumbnails\nUpdated and optimized the ccf-database for the new results structure and future integrations\nTied organ carousel to the 3D scene. Turning off an organ removes the organ and related tissues from the 3D scene.\nTurned off anatomical structure opacity adjustment until it can be fully integrated\n\n1.4.0 - 2021-03-12\nAdded in RUI 1.4.0\n\nUpdated library dependencies, including to Angular 11\nUpdated styling to better fit the user interface spec\n\nAdded in EUI 1.4.0\nNOTE: EUI will not be pushed to production during this cycle as there are some features partly integrated. This should be resolved in the next release scheduled for March 26th. You can view the results of this sprint on staging.\n\nUpdated library dependencies, including to Angular 11\nUpdated styling to better fit the user interface spec and match RUI styling\nUpdated the Info Dialog to match the RUI look and feel\nUpdated the data processing to improve efficiency and generate data in the form needed for the v1.5.0 spec\nAdded a reference organ selector, also used in the RUI, to turn off/on reference organs on the stage. UI is implemented, but still needs hooked up to the 3d Stage.\nAdded a technology filter\nAdded a control to set Opacities of individual organs/anatomical structures on the stage. UI is implemented, but still needs hooked up to the 3d Stage.\n\n1.3.5 - 2021-02-26\nAdded in RUI 1.3.5\n\nUpdated with a new round of User Interface improvements\nAdded the ability to upload previous registrations created using the standalone version of the RUI tool\nOrgans now have transparency applied automatically\nSolved a major memory leak and performance issue with the 3D reference organ interface. You should notice a sizable speed and reliability increase.\nRUI location numeric data is now rounded to 3 digits\nSwitched to using GitHub Actions over TravisCI for our CI/CD workflows\n\nAdded in EUI 1.3.5\n\nRemoved CCF's internal image-viewer in favor of the image-viewer on the HuBMAP Data Portal\n\nEUI 1.2.0 / RUI 1.0 FINAL - 2020-10-30\nAdded in EUI 1.2.0 / RUI 1.0 FINAL\n\nBug fixes and improvements\nUpdated embedding API in collaboration with the IEC\nUpdated EUI codebase to be in sync with code changes made for the RUI\nAdded KPMP data to the EUI\n\nKnown Issues in EUI 1.2.0 / RUI 1.0 FINAL\n\nIt is still possible that a 3d organ may fail to load. If this happens, just refresh and try again.\nEUI has not been updated with the latest organ set. This will be added in December with its scheduled refresh.\n\nRUI 1.0 BETA - 2020-10-16\nAdded in RUI 1.0 BETA\n\nCreated the first version of the RUI 1.0. This version is a BETA and works in standalone mode only. The next version will include full support and integration into the HuBMAP Ingestion Portal.\n10 Reference Organs are available to choose from (a combination of 4 organs, 2 sexes, and one organ with 2 sides [kidney])\nImplemented automatic tagging of data via collisions with anatomical structures\nRUI Location data is in standard JSON-LD format linked via the CCF Ontology and related ontologies\nImplemented extraction sites display to help guide placement of tissues\n\nKnown Issues in RUI 1.0 BETA\n\nWhile support for embedding is implemented, more testing and collaboration with IEC is required before it is made fully available. Initial embedding documentation is available here.\nWhen adjusting transparency via the left-hand Anatomical Structures menu or Show Previous Registrations option, the transparency effect is not very good. This will be addressed before the RUI 1.0 production release.\nSometimes the 3d organ fails to load when clicking through reference organs quickly (and other side cases). If this happens, just refresh and try again.\n\n1.1.0 - 2020-07-31\nAdded in 1.1.0\n\nUpgraded to latest Vitessce Image Viewer and started showing processed TIFF images coming directly from the HuBMAP infrastructure\nProcessed CODEX and 10x datasets are shown in the HuBMAP Portal's visualization tool\nAdded a limited set of TIFF image thumbnails, with more to come\nAdded two qualitative color schemes for colorizing images in the image viewer\nBug fixes/performance optimizations\n\n1.0.0-rc.1 - 2020-06-22\n\n:warning: WARNING: This version is a release candidate.
