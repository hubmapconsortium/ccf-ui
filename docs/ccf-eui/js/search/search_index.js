2023-07-12\nAdded in 3.7.2\n\nClient side cache has been updated to be more sensitive to configuration changes. Fixes hra-registrations#1\n\n3.7.0 - 2023-06-15\nAdded in 3.7.0\n\nUpdated to CCF.OWL v2.2.0 which indexes the Human Reference Atlas (HRA) 5th Release (v1.4) for use in the CCF UIs and CCF-API.\nAdded CCF-API usage notebooks for python and javascript\n\n3.6.0 - 2022-10-15\nAdded in 3.6.0.\n\nUpdated to CCF.OWL v2.1.0 which indexes the Human Reference Atlas (HRA) 4th Release (v1.3) for use in the CCF UIs and CCF-API. Note that some terms have changed in the ontology. As such, some SPARQL queries may need to be updated. All CCF-API calls have been updated to support the new terms.\n\n3.5.0 - 2022-09-27\nAdded in 3.5.0\n\nUpdate to CCF.OWL v1.9.4\nUpdate placement for KPMP rui locations\nSwitch to HuBMAP v3 search-api\nPick right organ when loading rui locations from a file in the RUI\n\n3.4.0 - 2022-07-01\nAdded in 3.4.0\n\nMajor feature added: Spatial Search! This includes an expanded API plus a user interface for dynamically generating spatial searches.\n\nKnown Issues in 3.4.0\n\nThere are some minor visual descrepancies when viewing the spatial search 3D scene and the results. However, blocks which are highlighted will be selected if the spatial search is added to your overall search filters.\n\n3.3.0 - 2022-06-17\nAdded in 3.3.0\n\nAdded support for the latest CCF Ontology v1.9.0 which adds Placenta, Spinal Cord, new Landmarks for reference organs, and a host of data updates.\nAdded a SPARQL route to the CCF-API for flexible querying of the Ontology and linked data. See the /v1/sparql docs for more information.\nClean up and bug fixes\n\n3.2.0 - 2022-04-14\nAdded in 3.2.0\n\nMajor CCF Database speed improvements! 95% reduction in load times!\nMinor graphical fixes\n\n3.1.1 - 2022-04-12\nAdded in 3.1.1\n\nExpanded RUI web component options\nAdded support for warming up the CCF database via the CCF-API so that the EUI can prevent timeouts\n\n3.1.0 - 2022-04-07\nAdded in 3.1.0\n\nAdded support for the latest CCF Ontology v1.8.0 which adds cell types\nAdded feature to search for tissue blocks by cell type\nAdded API feature to dynamically generate GTEx rui_locations.jsonld\nAdded logging of organ and block position changes to the RUI\nAdded an expanded organ selector that makes selecting organs much easier with the larger number of reference organs we have now\nNow generating programming libraries for the CCF-API in Python, TypeScript, TypeScript (Angular), and JavaScript. We will be publishing them to appropriate package managers soon.\nImproved performance of the CCF-API\nNew theming options and toggle for the CCF EUI/RUI\nAdded new themes for SenNet, GTEx, and a default theme\nAdded compodoc generated code documentation to production and staging builds\nBug fixes and minor improvements\n\n3.0.0 - 2022-01-27\nAdded in 3.0.0\n\nAdded support for the latest CCF Ontology v1.7.0\nBug fixes and code cleanup\n\n3.0.0 BETA - 2021-12-17\nAdded in 3.0.0 BETA\n\nAdded reference organs and ASCT+B tables from the v1.1 CCF Release\nLinks: CCF Ontology v1.7 BETA, CCF Release v1.1\n\n\n\nKnown issues in 3.0.0 BETA\n\nPreviously registered tissues may appear slightly off. We are working to rectify this before making it a production release.\n\n2.5.0 - 2021-12-17\nAdded in 2.5.0\n\nCCF-API OpenAPI Spec and implementation. Next version will connect the EUI to this as it's backend.\nAdded the CCF Body UI Web Component for integrating the 3D scene deeply in webpages (including the HuBMAP data portal).\nThe organ-info Web Component can now take an option to highlight specific blocks in the scene.
