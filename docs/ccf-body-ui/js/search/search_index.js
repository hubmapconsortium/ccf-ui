This includes an expanded API plus a user interface for dynamically generating spatial searches.\n\nKnown Issues in 3.4.0\n\nThere are some minor visual descrepancies when viewing the spatial search 3D scene and the results. However, blocks which are highlighted will be selected if the spatial search is added to your overall search filters.\n\n3.3.0 - 2022-06-17\nAdded in 3.3.0\n\nAdded support for the latest CCF Ontology v1.9.0 which adds Placenta, Spinal Cord, new Landmarks for reference organs, and a host of data updates.\nAdded a SPARQL route to the CCF-API for flexible querying of the Ontology and linked data. See the /v1/sparql docs for more information.\nClean up and bug fixes\n\n3.2.0 - 2022-04-14\nAdded in 3.2.0\n\nMajor CCF Database speed improvements! 95% reduction in load times!\nMinor graphical fixes\n\n3.1.1 - 2022-04-12\nAdded in 3.1.1\n\nExpanded RUI web component options\nAdded support for warming up the CCF database via the CCF-API so that the EUI can prevent timeouts\n\n3.1.0 - 2022-04-07\nAdded in 3.1.0\n\nAdded support for the latest CCF Ontology v1.8.0 which adds cell types\nAdded feature to search for tissue blocks by cell type\nAdded API feature to dynamically generate GTEx rui_locations.jsonld\nAdded logging of organ and block position changes to the RUI\nAdded an expanded organ selector that makes selecting organs much easier with the larger number of reference organs we have now\nNow generating programming libraries for the CCF-API in Python, TypeScript, TypeScript (Angular), and JavaScript. We will be publishing them to appropriate package managers soon.\nImproved performance of the CCF-API\nNew theming options and toggle for the CCF EUI/RUI\nAdded new themes for SenNet, GTEx, and a default theme\nAdded compodoc generated code documentation to production and staging builds\nBug fixes and minor improvements\n\n3.0.0 - 2022-01-27\nAdded in 3.0.0\n\nAdded support for the latest CCF Ontology v1.7.0\nBug fixes and code cleanup\n\n3.0.0 BETA - 2021-12-17\nAdded in 3.0.0 BETA\n\nAdded reference organs and ASCT+B tables from the v1.1 CCF Release\nLinks: CCF Ontology v1.7 BETA, CCF Release v1.1\n\n\n\nKnown issues in 3.0.0 BETA\n\nPreviously registered tissues may appear slightly off. We are working to rectify this before making it a production release.\n\n2.5.0 - 2021-12-17\nAdded in 2.5.0\n\nCCF-API OpenAPI Spec and implementation. Next version will connect the EUI to this as it's backend.\nAdded the CCF Body UI Web Component for integrating the 3D scene deeply in webpages (including the HuBMAP data portal).\nThe organ-info Web Component can now take an option to highlight specific blocks in the scene. Currently only highlights by providers, but age, sex, and BMI will be added in the next version.\nBug fixes and Quality of Life improvements\n\n2.4.0 - 2021-12-10\nAdded in 2.4.0\n\nRUI shows a confirmation dialog when a user attempts to leave without finishing registration\nAdded GTEx data to EUI\nRUI Common Extraction Sites are now known as Landmarks\nOrgan info now highlights the block selected on click\nUpdated RUI YouTube Demo link\nBug fixes and Quality of Life improvements\n\n2.3.1 - 2021-09-13\nAdded in 2.3.1\n\nAdded support for paired organs to be refernced by their parent (ala Kidney + Left/Right Kidney)\n\n2.3.0 - 2021-09-10\nAdded in 2.3.0\n\nGreatly improved CCF Database performance. This improves the performance in both organ-info and EUI.\nImproved styling of organ-info\n\n2.2.0 - 2021-09-10\nAdded in 2.2.0\n\nAdded an organ-info web component for displaying reference organs and associated data in a simple panel display. The hubmap portal will be using this soon for organ pages.\nEMBEDDING.md instructions have been updated for organ-info embedding.\n\n2.1.0 - 2021-07-30\nAdded in EUI / RUI 2.1.0\n\nBetter support for embedding EUI/RUI in different containers, see EMBEDDING.md for updated instructions.\nConfiguration updates:\nConfiguration of EUI/RUI via webcomponent properties (vs globalConfig)\nOptional use of ontology id to select reference organs in the RUI\nRemoved embedded and tutorial mode configurations from the RUI config\nAbility to load data sources in the eui via external configuration\nAdded cancelRegistration callback to rui external configuration\n\n\nSet dark/light theme based on user/OS preferences\nUpdate HuBMAP search processing to conform to new field names\nCode cleanup, shared utilities, etc.\nTelemetry dialog box fixes to avoid unnecessary reloads\nRUI gizmo rotates in sync with the reference organ in 3D preview view\nRUI now uses an orthographic view when in registration views\n\n2.0.0 - 2021-07-16\nAdded in EUI / RUI 2.0.0\n\nRUI and EUI are now basic web-components, see EMBEDDING.md\nAdded advanced google analytics tracking/telemetry\nLinked donor card and tissue block hovering\nUpdated dependencies, including upgrading to Angular 12\nMinor UI and Bug fixes\nUpdated demo video links\nOrgan carousel will respond to container width and show only full icons\nEUI: clicking refresh and selecting body on partonomy resets the body view\n\nBreaking changes in EUI / RUI 2.0.0\n\nEmbedding the EUI and RUI must now be done via web-components. The most significant change is the element is no longer called ccf-root but is instead called ccf-eui or ccf-rui depending on the UI being embedded.\n\n1.7.0 - 2021-05-21\nAdded in EUI / RUI 1.7.0\n\nAdded a startup modal to the RUI which simplifies the initial setup for a new registration\nAdded 8 new reference organs, bringing us to 13 Reference Organs!\nAdded SPARC Registrations to the EUI\nAdded a tissue section visualization to the results list in the EUI\n\n1.6.0 - 2021-04-09\nAdded in RUI 1.6.0\n\nAdded SOP information to the About section\n\nAdded in EUI 1.6.0\n\nAdded color assignment/selection to both 3d scene and list results\nBug fixes, code cleanup, and optimization\n\nKnown issues in 1.6.0\n\nThe 3d scene is a little slow. To be able to interact, unselect reference organs to reduce scene complexity.\nTissue samples may be a little off in the 3D scene. This will be fixed in a future release.

If this happens, just refresh and try again.\nEUI has not been updated with the latest organ set. This will be added in December with its scheduled refresh.\n\nRUI 1.0 BETA - 2020-10-16\nAdded in RUI 1.0 BETA\n\nCreated the first version of the RUI 1.0. This version is a BETA and works in standalone mode only. The next version will include full support and integration into the HuBMAP Ingestion Portal.\n10 Reference Organs are available to choose from (a combination of 4 organs, 2 sexes, and one organ with 2 sides [kidney])\nImplemented automatic tagging of data via collisions with anatomical structures\nRUI Location data is in standard JSON-LD format linked via the CCF Ontology and related ontologies\nImplemented extraction sites display to help guide placement of tissues\n\nKnown Issues in RUI 1.0 BETA\n\nWhile support for embedding is implemented, more testing and collaboration with IEC is required before it is made fully available. Initial embedding documentation is available here.\nWhen adjusting transparency via the left-hand Anatomical Structures menu or Show Previous Registrations option, the transparency effect is not very good. This will be addressed before the RUI 1.0 production release.\nSometimes the 3d organ fails to load when clicking through reference organs quickly (and other side cases). If this happens, just refresh and try again.\n\n1.1.0 - 2020-07-31\nAdded in 1.1.0\n\nUpgraded to latest Vitessce Image Viewer and started showing processed TIFF images coming directly from the HuBMAP infrastructure\nProcessed CODEX and 10x datasets are shown in the HuBMAP Portal's visualization tool\nAdded a limited set of TIFF image thumbnails, with more to come\nAdded two qualitative color schemes for colorizing images in the image viewer\nBug fixes/performance optimizations\n\n1.0.0-rc.1 - 2020-06-22\n\n:warning: WARNING: This version is a release candidate.
