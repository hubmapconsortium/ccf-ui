Fixes hra-registrations#1\n\n3.7.0 - 2023-06-15\nAdded in 3.7.0\n\nUpdated to CCF.OWL v2.2.0 which indexes the Human Reference Atlas (HRA) 5th Release (v1.4) for use in the CCF UIs and CCF-API.\nAdded CCF-API usage notebooks for python and javascript\n\n3.6.0 - 2022-10-15\nAdded in 3.6.0.\n\nUpdated to CCF.OWL v2.1.0 which indexes the Human Reference Atlas (HRA) 4th Release (v1.3) for use in the CCF UIs and CCF-API. Note that some terms have changed in the ontology. As such, some SPARQL queries may need to be updated. All CCF-API calls have been updated to support the new terms.\n\n3.5.0 - 2022-09-27\nAdded in 3.5.0\n\nUpdate to CCF.OWL v1.9.4\nUpdate placement for KPMP rui locations\nSwitch to HuBMAP v3 search-api\nPick right organ when loading rui locations from a file in the RUI\n\n3.4.0 - 2022-07-01\nAdded in 3.4.0\n\nMajor feature added: Spatial Search! This includes an expanded API plus a user interface for dynamically generating spatial searches.\n\nKnown Issues in 3.4.0\n\nThere are some minor visual descrepancies when viewing the spatial search 3D scene and the results.
