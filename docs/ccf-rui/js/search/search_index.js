You can view the results of this sprint on staging.\n\nUpdated library dependencies, including to Angular 11\nUpdated styling to better fit the user interface spec and match RUI styling\nUpdated the Info Dialog to match the RUI look and feel\nUpdated the data processing to improve efficiency and generate data in the form needed for the v1.5.0 spec\nAdded a reference organ selector, also used in the RUI, to turn off/on reference organs on the stage. UI is implemented, but still needs hooked up to the 3d Stage.\nAdded a technology filter\nAdded a control to set Opacities of individual organs/anatomical structures on the stage. UI is implemented, but still needs hooked up to the 3d Stage.\n\n1.3.5 - 2021-02-26\nAdded in RUI 1.3.5\n\nUpdated with a new round of User Interface improvements\nAdded the ability to upload previous registrations created using the standalone version of the RUI tool\nOrgans now have transparency applied automatically\nSolved a major memory leak and performance issue with the 3D reference organ interface. You should notice a sizable speed and reliability increase.\nRUI location numeric data is now rounded to 3 digits\nSwitched to using GitHub Actions over TravisCI for our CI/CD workflows\n\nAdded in EUI 1.3.5\n\nRemoved CCF's internal image-viewer in favor of the image-viewer on the HuBMAP Data Portal\n\nEUI 1.2.0 / RUI 1.0 FINAL - 2020-10-30\nAdded in EUI 1.2.0 / RUI 1.0 FINAL\n\nBug fixes and improvements\nUpdated embedding API in collaboration with the IEC\nUpdated EUI codebase to be in sync with code changes made for the RUI\nAdded KPMP data to the EUI\n\nKnown Issues in EUI 1.2.0 / RUI 1.0 FINAL\n\nIt is still possible that a 3d organ may fail to load. If this happens, just refresh and try again.\nEUI has not been updated with the latest organ set. This will be added in December with its scheduled refresh.\n\nRUI 1.0 BETA - 2020-10-16\nAdded in RUI 1.0 BETA\n\nCreated the first version of the RUI 1.0. This version is a BETA and works in standalone mode only. The next version will include full support and integration into the HuBMAP Ingestion Portal.\n10 Reference Organs are available to choose from (a combination of 4 organs, 2 sexes, and one organ with 2 sides [kidney])\nImplemented automatic tagging of data via collisions with anatomical structures\nRUI Location data is in standard JSON-LD format linked via the CCF Ontology and related ontologies\nImplemented extraction sites display to help guide placement of tissues\n\nKnown Issues in RUI 1.0 BETA\n\nWhile support for embedding is implemented, more testing and collaboration with IEC is required before it is made fully available. Initial embedding documentation is available here.\nWhen adjusting transparency via the left-hand Anatomical Structures menu or Show Previous Registrations option, the transparency effect is not very good. This will be addressed before the RUI 1.0 production release.\nSometimes the 3d organ fails to load when clicking through reference organs quickly (and other side cases). If this happens, just refresh and try again.\n\n1.1.0 - 2020-07-31\nAdded in 1.1.0\n\nUpgraded to latest Vitessce Image Viewer and started showing processed TIFF images coming directly from the HuBMAP infrastructure\nProcessed CODEX and 10x datasets are shown in the HuBMAP Portal's visualization tool\nAdded a limited set of TIFF image thumbnails, with more to come\nAdded two qualitative color schemes for colorizing images in the image viewer\nBug fixes/performance optimizations\n\n1.0.0-rc.1 - 2020-06-22\n\n:warning: WARNING: This version is a release candidate. Some minor updates will likely happen between now and the official HuBMAP Data Release 1 in July.\n\nAdded in 1.0.0-rc.1\n\nBody UI interactions\nImage Viewer Integration\nPartonomy linkage to search / Body UI\nNow fully integrated into the HuBMAP Portal\n\nKnown Issues in 1.0.0-rc.1\n\nImage Viewer is using a placeholder .tiff until more .tiff images can be loaded from the IEC\n\n1.0.0-alpha.3 - 2019-05-08\nAdded in 1.0.0-alpha.3\n\nHooked up the interface to real data (not shown online as the data is not public yet)\nAdded the Tissue Browser on the right\nAdded the initial (Tissue) Image Viewer popup. Currently shows metadata, but no images yet.\nAdded an initial 3D Body. Tissues cuboids currently not displayed, but a test cuboid is shown.\nDocumentation (>90%) and testing coverage improved further\n\n1.0.0-alpha.2 - 2019-03-27\nAdded in 1.0.0-alpha.2\n\nIncreased documentation and testing coverage across the board\nAdded fullscreen button\nBug fixes and optimizations\n\n1.0.0-alpha.1 - 2019-03-06\nAdded in 1.0.0-alpha.1\n\nStarted the process of implementing the 1.0.0 UI spec\nSpec Doc\nUser Stories\n\n\nSetup the base project scaffolding for the new version\nAdded CCF Partonomy (CCF-P) search and tree display\nAdded a filter for filter tissues\n\n0.6.0 - 2019-11-08\nAdded in 0.6.0\n\nThe CCF API project was started with an initial OpenAPI Schema, documentation, and code for spinning up a mock data server. This codifies the CCF data and metadata standards defined by MC-IU and will be used by the CCF EUI and RUI.\nIn preparation for future developments, we added a hidden, alpha-level 3d organ viewer. You can toggle this on and off in the organ view, by typing 3d with your keyboard.\nUpdated navigation to directly jump to the tissue browser when a user selects an item from the search box\nUpgraded dependencies, including upgrades to Angular 8\nTesting and bug fixes\nMinor UI updates\nChanged download icon color\nChanged the background color for the search\nMoved the Technologies filter above ontology\nAdditional styles for details button\n\n\n\n0.5.0 - 2019-05-24\nAdded in 0.5.0\n\nDisplay of the CCF ontology, integrated with search\nSemantic search by ontology, results are presented at all levels\nTissue overlays showing regions of interest\nData download links to direct users to https://sampledata.hubmapconsortium.org\nData documentation (95% coverage) and testing (85% coverage)\n\n0.2.0 - 2019-05-03\nAdded in 0.2.0\n\nSprint 2 release of the CCF-UI!\nA search interface was added to query data by age, sex, technology and TMC.
