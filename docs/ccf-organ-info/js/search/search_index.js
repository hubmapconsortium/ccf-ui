We will be publishing them to appropriate package managers soon.\nImproved performance of the CCF-API\nNew theming options and toggle for the CCF EUI/RUI\nAdded new themes for SenNet, GTEx, and a default theme\nAdded compodoc generated code documentation to production and staging builds\nBug fixes and minor improvements\n\n3.0.0 - 2022-01-27\nAdded in 3.0.0\n\nAdded support for the latest CCF Ontology v1.7.0\nBug fixes and code cleanup\n\n3.0.0 BETA - 2021-12-17\nAdded in 3.0.0 BETA\n\nAdded reference organs and ASCT+B tables from the v1.1 CCF Release\nLinks: CCF Ontology v1.7 BETA, CCF Release v1.1\n\n\n\nKnown issues in 3.0.0 BETA\n\nPreviously registered tissues may appear slightly off. We are working to rectify this before making it a production release.\n\n2.5.0 - 2021-12-17\nAdded in 2.5.0\n\nCCF-API OpenAPI Spec and implementation. Next version will connect the EUI to this as it's backend.\nAdded the CCF Body UI Web Component for integrating the 3D scene deeply in webpages (including the HuBMAP data portal).\nThe organ-info Web Component can now take an option to highlight specific blocks in the scene. Currently only highlights by providers, but age, sex, and BMI will be added in the next version.\nBug fixes and Quality of Life improvements\n\n2.4.0 - 2021-12-10\nAdded in 2.4.0\n\nRUI shows a confirmation dialog when a user attempts to leave without finishing registration\nAdded GTEx data to EUI\nRUI Common Extraction Sites are now known as Landmarks\nOrgan info now highlights the block selected on click\nUpdated RUI YouTube Demo link\nBug fixes and Quality of Life improvements\n\n2.3.1 - 2021-09-13\nAdded in 2.3.1\n\nAdded support for paired organs to be refernced by their parent (ala Kidney + Left/Right Kidney)\n\n2.3.0 - 2021-09-10\nAdded in 2.3.0\n\nGreatly improved CCF Database performance. This improves the performance in both organ-info and EUI.\nImproved styling of organ-info\n\n2.2.0 - 2021-09-10\nAdded in 2.2.0\n\nAdded an organ-info web component for displaying reference organs and associated data in a simple panel display.

You can view the results of this sprint on staging.\n\nUpdated styling to better fit the user interface spec\nAdded a new results pane which structures data into Donor->Tissue Blocks (+Datasets)->Tissue Samples (+Datasets)\nAdded a link viewer that allows us to display donors, samples, and datasets in a frame within the application\nAdded UFL thumbnails\nUpdated and optimized the ccf-database for the new results structure and future integrations\nTied organ carousel to the 3D scene. Turning off an organ removes the organ and related tissues from the 3D scene.\nTurned off anatomical structure opacity adjustment until it can be fully integrated\n\n1.4.0 - 2021-03-12\nAdded in RUI 1.4.0\n\nUpdated library dependencies, including to Angular 11\nUpdated styling to better fit the user interface spec\n\nAdded in EUI 1.4.0\nNOTE: EUI will not be pushed to production during this cycle as there are some features partly integrated. This should be resolved in the next release scheduled for March 26th. You can view the results of this sprint on staging.\n\nUpdated library dependencies, including to Angular 11\nUpdated styling to better fit the user interface spec and match RUI styling\nUpdated the Info Dialog to match the RUI look and feel\nUpdated the data processing to improve efficiency and generate data in the form needed for the v1.5.0 spec\nAdded a reference organ selector, also used in the RUI, to turn off/on reference organs on the stage. UI is implemented, but still needs hooked up to the 3d Stage.\nAdded a technology filter\nAdded a control to set Opacities of individual organs/anatomical structures on the stage. UI is implemented, but still needs hooked up to the 3d Stage.\n\n1.3.5 - 2021-02-26\nAdded in RUI 1.3.5\n\nUpdated with a new round of User Interface improvements\nAdded the ability to upload previous registrations created using the standalone version of the RUI tool\nOrgans now have transparency applied automatically\nSolved a major memory leak and performance issue with the 3D reference organ interface. You should notice a sizable speed and reliability increase.\nRUI location numeric data is now rounded to 3 digits\nSwitched to using GitHub Actions over TravisCI for our CI/CD workflows\n\nAdded in EUI 1.3.5\n\nRemoved CCF's internal image-viewer in favor of the image-viewer on the HuBMAP Data Portal\n\nEUI 1.2.0 / RUI 1.0 FINAL - 2020-10-30\nAdded in EUI 1.2.0 / RUI 1.0 FINAL\n\nBug fixes and improvements\nUpdated embedding API in collaboration with the IEC\nUpdated EUI codebase to be in sync with code changes made for the RUI\nAdded KPMP data to the EUI\n\nKnown Issues in EUI 1.2.0 / RUI 1.0 FINAL\n\nIt is still possible that a 3d organ may fail to load. If this happens, just refresh and try again.\nEUI has not been updated with the latest organ set. This will be added in December with its scheduled refresh.\n\nRUI 1.0 BETA - 2020-10-16\nAdded in RUI 1.0 BETA\n\nCreated the first version of the RUI 1.0. This version is a BETA and works in standalone mode only. The next version will include full support and integration into the HuBMAP Ingestion Portal.\n10 Reference Organs are available to choose from (a combination of 4 organs, 2 sexes, and one organ with 2 sides [kidney])\nImplemented automatic tagging of data via collisions with anatomical structures\nRUI Location data is in standard JSON-LD format linked via the CCF Ontology and related ontologies\nImplemented extraction sites display to help guide placement of tissues\n\nKnown Issues in RUI 1.0 BETA\n\nWhile support for embedding is implemented, more testing and collaboration with IEC is required before it is made fully available. Initial embedding documentation is available here.\nWhen adjusting transparency via the left-hand Anatomical Structures menu or Show Previous Registrations option, the transparency effect is not very good. This will be addressed before the RUI 1.0 production release.\nSometimes the 3d organ fails to load when clicking through reference organs quickly (and other side cases). If this happens, just refresh and try again.\n\n1.1.0 - 2020-07-31\nAdded in 1.1.0\n\nUpgraded to latest Vitessce Image Viewer and started showing processed TIFF images coming directly from the HuBMAP infrastructure\nProcessed CODEX and 10x datasets are shown in the HuBMAP Portal's visualization tool\nAdded a limited set of TIFF image thumbnails, with more to come\nAdded two qualitative color schemes for colorizing images in the image viewer\nBug fixes/performance optimizations\n\n1.0.0-rc.1 - 2020-06-22\n\n:warning: WARNING: This version is a release candidate. Some minor updates will likely happen between now and the official HuBMAP Data Release 1 in July.\n\nAdded in 1.0.0-rc.1\n\nBody UI interactions\nImage Viewer Integration\nPartonomy linkage to search / Body UI\nNow fully integrated into the HuBMAP Portal\n\nKnown Issues in 1.0.0-rc.1\n\nImage Viewer is using a placeholder .tiff until more .tiff images can be loaded from the IEC\n\n1.0.0-alpha.3 - 2019-05-08\nAdded in 1.0.0-alpha.3\n\nHooked up the interface to real data (not shown online as the data is not public yet)\nAdded the Tissue Browser on the right\nAdded the initial (Tissue) Image Viewer popup. Currently shows metadata, but no images yet.\nAdded an initial 3D Body. Tissues cuboids currently not displayed, but a test cuboid is shown.\nDocumentation (>90%) and testing coverage improved further\n\n1.0.0-alpha.2 - 2019-03-27\nAdded in 1.0.0-alpha.2\n\nIncreased documentation and testing coverage across the board\nAdded fullscreen button\nBug fixes and optimizations\n\n1.0.0-alpha.1 - 2019-03-06\nAdded in 1.0.0-alpha.1\n\nStarted the process of implementing the 1.0.0 UI spec\nSpec Doc\nUser Stories\n\n\nSetup the base project scaffolding for the new version\nAdded CCF Partonomy (CCF-P) search and tree display\nAdded a filter for filter tissues\n\n0.6.0 - 2019-11-08\nAdded in 0.6.0\n\nThe CCF API project was started with an initial OpenAPI Schema, documentation, and code for spinning up a mock data server.
