Initial embedding documentation is available here.\nWhen adjusting transparency via the left-hand Anatomical Structures menu or Show Previous Registrations option, the transparency effect is not very good. This will be addressed before the RUI 1.0 production release.\nSometimes the 3d organ fails to load when clicking through reference organs quickly (and other side cases).

Tissues cuboids currently not displayed, but a test cuboid is shown.\nDocumentation (>90%) and testing coverage improved further\n\n1.0.0-alpha.2 - 2019-03-27\nAdded in 1.0.0-alpha.2\n\nIncreased documentation and testing coverage across the board\nAdded fullscreen button\nBug fixes and optimizations\n\n1.0.0-alpha.1 - 2019-03-06\nAdded in 1.0.0-alpha.1\n\nStarted the process of implementing the 1.0.0 UI spec\nSpec Doc\nUser Stories\n\n\nSetup the base project scaffolding for the new version\nAdded CCF Partonomy (CCF-P) search and tree display\nAdded a filter for filter tissues\n\n0.6.0 - 2019-11-08\nAdded in 0.6.0\n\nThe CCF API project was started with an initial OpenAPI Schema, documentation, and code for spinning up a mock data server. This codifies the CCF data and metadata standards defined by MC-IU and will be used by the CCF EUI and RUI.\nIn preparation for future developments, we added a hidden, alpha-level 3d organ viewer. You can toggle this on and off in the organ view, by typing 3d with your keyboard.\nUpdated navigation to directly jump to the tissue browser when a user selects an item from the search box\nUpgraded dependencies, including upgrades to Angular 8\nTesting and bug fixes\nMinor UI updates\nChanged download icon color\nChanged the background color for the search\nMoved the Technologies filter above ontology\nAdditional styles for details button\n\n\n\n0.5.0 - 2019-05-24\nAdded in 0.5.0\n\nDisplay of the CCF ontology, integrated with search\nSemantic search by ontology, results are presented at all levels\nTissue overlays showing regions of interest\nData download links to direct users to https://sampledata.hubmapconsortium.org\nData documentation (95% coverage) and testing (85% coverage)\n\n0.2.0 - 2019-05-03\nAdded in 0.2.0\n\nSprint 2 release of the CCF-UI!\nA search interface was added to query data by age, sex, technology and TMC.
