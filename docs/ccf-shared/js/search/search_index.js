the Human Reference Atlas (HRA) 5th Release (v1.4) for use in the CCF UIs and CCF-API.\nAdded CCF-API usage notebooks for python and javascript\n\n3.6.0 - 2022-10-15\nAdded in 3.6.0.\n\nUpdated to CCF.OWL v2.1.0 which indexes the Human Reference Atlas (HRA) 4th Release (v1.3) for use in the CCF UIs and CCF-API. Note that some terms have changed in the ontology. As such, some SPARQL queries may need to be updated. All CCF-API calls have been updated to support the new terms.\n\n3.5.0 - 2022-09-27\nAdded in 3.5.0\n\nUpdate to CCF.OWL v1.9.4\nUpdate placement for KPMP rui locations\nSwitch to HuBMAP v3 search-api\nPick right organ when loading rui locations from a file in the RUI\n\n3.4.0 - 2022-07-01\nAdded in 3.4.0\n\nMajor feature added: Spatial Search! This includes an expanded API plus a user interface for dynamically generating spatial searches.\n\nKnown Issues in 3.4.0\n\nThere are some minor visual descrepancies when viewing the spatial search 3D scene and the results. However, blocks which are highlighted will be selected if the spatial search is added to your overall search filters.\n\n3.3.0 - 2022-06-17\nAdded in 3.3.0\n\nAdded support for the latest CCF Ontology v1.9.0 which adds Placenta, Spinal Cord, new Landmarks for reference organs, and a host of data updates.\nAdded a SPARQL route to the CCF-API for flexible querying of the Ontology and linked data.
