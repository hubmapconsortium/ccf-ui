## 1.7.0 - 2021-05-21

### Added in EUI / RUI 1.7.0

### Added in EUI 1.6.0

* Added color assignment/selection to both 3d scene and list results

## 1.5.0 - 2021-03-26

### Added in RUI 1.5.0

* Minor styling updates

### Added in EUI 1.5.0

NOTE: EUI will not be pushed to production during this cycle as there are some features not fully integrated. This should be resolved in the next release scheduled for April 9th. You can view the results of this sprint on [staging](https://hubmap-ccf-ui.netlify.app/).

* Updated styling to better fit the [user interface spec](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15mx__aHeNDCBBYBXM64ED6YAOeyp9Fcy/view)

* Added a link viewer that allows us to display donors, samples, and datasets in a frame within the application
* Added UFL thumbnails
* Updated and optimized the ccf-database for the new results structure and future integrations
* Tied organ carousel to the 3D scene. Turning off an organ removes the organ and related tissues from the 3D scene.

## 1.4.0 - 2021-03-12

### Added in RUI 1.4.0

* Updated library dependencies, including to Angular 11
* Updated styling to better fit the [user interface spec](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1M0Pfu41Kv-RBOvIF9hB-mcNK9U4qsDIp/view)

### Added in EUI 1.4.0

NOTE: EUI will not be pushed to production during this cycle as there are some features partly integrated. This should be resolved in the next release scheduled for March 26th. You can view the results of this sprint on [staging](https://hubmap-ccf-ui.netlify.app/).

* Updated library dependencies, including to Angular 11

* Updated the Info Dialog to match the RUI look and feel
* Updated the data processing to improve efficiency and generate data in the form needed for the v1.5.0 spec
* Added a reference organ selector, also used in the RUI, to turn off/on reference organs on the stage. UI is implemented, but still needs hooked up to the 3d Stage.
* Added a technology filter
* Added a control to set Opacities of individual organs/anatomical structures on the stage. UI is implemented, but still needs hooked up to the 3d Stage.

## 1.3.5 - 2021-02-26

### Added in RUI 1.3.5

### Added in EUI 1.2.0 / RUI 1.0 FINAL

* Bug fixes and improvements
* Updated embedding API in collaboration with the IEC
* Updated EUI codebase to be in sync with code changes made for the RUI
* Added KPMP data to the EUI

### Known Issues in EUI 1.2.0 / RUI 1.0 FINAL

* It is still possible that a 3d organ may fail to load. If this happens, just refresh and try again.
* EUI has not been updated with the latest organ set. This will be added in December with its scheduled refresh.

## RUI 1.0 BETA - 2020-10-16

### Added in RUI 1.0 BETA

* Created the first version of the RUI 1.0. This version is a BETA and works in standalone mode only. The next version will include full support and integration into the HuBMAP Ingestion Portal.
* 10 Reference Organs are available to choose from (a combination of 4 organs, 2 sexes, and one organ with 2 sides [kidney])
* Implemented automatic tagging of data via collisions with anatomical structures
* RUI Location data is in standard JSON-LD format linked via the CCF Ontology and related ontologies
* Implemented extraction sites display to help guide placement of tissues

### Known Issues in RUI 1.0 BETA

* While support for embedding is implemented, more testing and collaboration with IEC is required before it is made fully available. Initial embedding documentation is available [here](EMBEDDING.md).
* When adjusting transparency via the left-hand `Anatomical Structures` menu or `Show Previous Registrations` option, the transparency effect is not very good. This will be addressed before the RUI 1.0 production release.
* Sometimes the 3d organ fails to load when clicking through reference organs quickly (and other side cases). If this happens, just refresh and try again.
