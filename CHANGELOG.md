# Changelog

Changelog for the Common Coordinate Framework (CCF) User Interfaces - CCF Exploration User Interface (EUI) and CCF Registration User Interface (RUI)

## 1.4.0 - 2021-03-12

### Added in RUI 1.4.0

* Updated library dependencies, including to Angular 11
* Updated styling to better fit the [user interface spec](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1M0Pfu41Kv-RBOvIF9hB-mcNK9U4qsDIp/view)

### Added in EUI 1.4.0

NOTE: EUI will not be pushed to production during this cycle as there are some features partly integrated. This will be resolved in the next release scheduled for March 26th. You can view the results of this sprint on [staging](https://hubmap-ccf-ui.netlify.app/).

* Updated library dependencies, including to Angular 11
* Updated styling to better fit the [user interface spec](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15mx__aHeNDCBBYBXM64ED6YAOeyp9Fcy/view) and match RUI styling
* Updated the Info Dialog to match the RUI look and feel
* Updated the data processing to improve efficiency and generate data in the form needed for the v1.5.0 spec
* Added a reference organ selector, also used in the RUI, to turn off/on reference organs on the stage. UI is implemented, but still needs hooked up to the 3d Stage.
* Added a technology filter
* Added a control to set Opacities of individual organs/anatomical structures on the stage. UI is implemented, but still needs hooked up to the 3d Stage.

## 1.3.5 - 2021-02-26

### Added in RUI 1.3.5

* Updated with a new round of [User Interface improvements](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1M0Pfu41Kv-RBOvIF9hB-mcNK9U4qsDIp/view)
* Added the ability to upload previous registrations created using the [standalone version](https://hubmapconsortium.github.io/ccf-ui/rui/) of the RUI tool
* Organs now have transparency applied automatically
* Solved a major memory leak and performance issue with the 3D reference organ interface. You should notice a sizable speed and reliability increase.
* RUI location numeric data is now rounded to 3 digits
* Switched to using GitHub Actions over TravisCI for our CI/CD workflows

### Added in EUI 1.3.5

* Removed CCF's internal image-viewer in favor of the image-viewer on the HuBMAP Data Portal

## EUI 1.2.0 / RUI 1.0 FINAL - 2020-10-30

### Added in EUI 1.2.0 / RUI 1.0 FINAL

* Bug fixes and improvements
* Updated embedding API in collaboration with the IEC
* Updated EUI codebase to be in sync with code changes made for the RUI
* Added KPMP data to the EUI

### Known Issues in EUI 1.2.0 / RUI 1.0 FINAL

* It is still possible that a 3d organ may fail to load. If this happens, just refresh and try again.
* EUI has not been updated with the latest organ set. This will be added in December with its scheduled refresh.

## RUI 1.0 BETA - 2020-10-16

### Added in RUI 1.0 BETA

* Created the first version of the RUI 1.0. This version is a BETA and works in standalone mode only. The next version will include full support and integration into the HuBMAP Ingestion Portal.
* 10 Reference Organs are available to choose from (a combination of 4 organs, 2 sexes, and one organ with 2 sides [kidney])
* Implemented automatic tagging of data via collisions with anatomical structures
* RUI Location data is in standard JSON-LD format linked via the CCF Ontology and related ontologies
* Implemented extraction sites display to help guide placement of tissues

### Known Issues in RUI 1.0 BETA

* While support for embedding is implemented, more testing and collaboration with IEC is required before it is made fully available. Initial embedding documentation is available [here](RUI_EMBEDDING.md).
* When adjusting transparency via the left-hand `Anatomical Structures` menu or `Show Previous Registrations` option, the transparency effect is not very good. This will be addressed before the RUI 1.0 production release.
* Sometimes the 3d organ fails to load when clicking through reference organs quickly (and other side cases). If this happens, just refresh and try again.

## 1.1.0 - 2020-07-31

## 0.6.0 - 2019-11-08

### Added in 0.6.0

This codifies the [CCF data and metadata standards](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Qgx4mNutE1V3CfQ7y8Lg3rxQy5nhiOSKCSv5MJkPRMc/edit) defined by MC-IU and will be used by the CCF EUI and RUI.
* In preparation for future developments, we added a hidden, alpha-level 3d organ viewer. You can toggle this on and off in the organ view, by typing 3d with your keyboard.
