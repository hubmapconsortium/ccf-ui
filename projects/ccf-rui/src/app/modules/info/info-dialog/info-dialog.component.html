          This Registration User Interface (RUI) supports the registration of three-dimensional (3D) tissue blocks within 3D reference organs. Surgeons and
          others involved in the tissue procurement process can use the interface to

        <ul>
          <li>
            Enter their name and select a reference organ (kidney; soon heart, lung, spleen, colon).
          </li>
          <li>
            Size the tissue block in three dimensions.
          </li>
          <li>
            Position and rotate the 3D tissue block within a 3D reference organ so its placement correctly mirrors the tissue block extraction site.
          </li>
          <li>
            Save all registration information into a clipboard for easy pasting into custom templates in REDCap (or other systems) used to keep track
            of tissue and tissue registration data. If using the RUI integrated into the HuBMAP Ingestion Portal, registration information is automatically
            saved with the associated tissue block.

        </ul>

          A first prototype of the CCF RUI became available in September 2019.  The CCF RUI specification is available
