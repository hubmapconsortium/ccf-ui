# How to use the EUI

- Select Organ: One can navigate available organs by selecting them from the carousel above the stage or using the ontology on the left.
- Filter: Above the Search is the Filter icon which opens a flyout with many options (e.g. Sex, Assay Types, etc) for refining what tissue data is presented.
- Registered Blocks: It is possible to select a block of tissue samples either using the bodies on stage or the cards in the right column. Color coding helps to identify different selections.
- Data: Using the cards in the right column, click on items to dig deeper into the data.

# About

The HRA Exploration User Interface (EUI) represents data across multiple scales, supporting navigation by
multiple coordinate systems, including spatial, physiologic, and organ-based browsing. The first
proof-of-concept user interface for the CCF v1.0.0 became available in June 2020. The EUI continues to evolve
as more data becomes available. The CCF EUI code is available
on <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/hubmapconsortium/ccf-ui" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.

# The Human Biomolecular Atlas Program

The Human Biomolecular Atlas Program (HuBMAP) will develop the next generation of molecular analysis
technologies, computational tools, and generate foundational tissue maps in order to accelerate the
construction of an atlas of the human body at single-cell resolution for understanding the relationship
between tissue organization and function.

# Human Reference Atlas (HRA) and Common Coordinate Framework (CCF)

The Human Reference Atlas (HRA) is under active development. It aims to semantically annotate and
spatially index HuBMAP data for efficient spatial and semantic search, browsing, and filtering. The CCF v1.0.0
became available in June 2020. The CCF Ontology is available as an <a rel="noopener noreferrer"
