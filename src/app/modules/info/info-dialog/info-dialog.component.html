                    The Human Biomolecular Atlas Project (HuBMAP) will develop the next generation of molecular analysis
                    technologies,
                    computational tools, and to generate foundational tissue maps in order to accelerate the
                    construction of an atlas of
                    the human body for the understanding the relationship between tissue organization and function.

                <h2 class="heading">Common Coordinate Framework (CCF)</h2>
                <p class="description">
                    The HuBMAP common coordinate (reference) framework is under active development. It aims to spatially
                    annotate and index
                    HuBMAP data so this data can be spatially located and explored efficiently. The CCF v0.5.0 became
                    available in March 2019.
                    CCF Ontology documentation is available <a rel="noopener noreferrer"

                <h2 class="heading">CCF Exploration User Interface (EUI)</h2>
                <p class="description">
                    The CCF EUI represents data across multiple scales, supporting navigation by multiple coordinate
                    systems,
                    including spatial, physiologic, and organ-based browsing. The first proof-of-concept user interface
                    for the CCF
                    v0.5.0 became available in June 2019 and continues to evolve as more data becomes available. CCF EUI
                    specification is
